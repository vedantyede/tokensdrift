# TokensDrift — Plain Guide

This file explains the whole project in plain words. It also lists every
command you may need, and when to use it.

The other files in this project (`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/tokensdrift-prd_1.md`,
`docs/tokensdrift-landing-copy_1.md`, `ROADMAP.md`) are written for other
purposes — build rules, a business plan, marketing copy, and a feature
checklist. This file is written for you to understand what exists and how
to use it.

---

## 1. What TokensDrift does

Big companies build a "design system." That means a shared set of colors,
spacing sizes, and styles that every screen should use. Developers call
these shared values **design tokens**.

Over time, developers get busy. Instead of using the shared blue color,
someone types `#1D4ED8` directly into the code. Instead of the shared
spacing size, someone types `13px`. This is called **drift** — the code
slowly moves away from the design system.

**TokensDrift is a tool that finds this drift.** You point it at a project's
code. It reads every CSS and React file (skipping test files — see below).
It finds:

1. **Hardcoded colors** — a color typed directly (like `#1D4ED8` or `gray`)
   instead of using a shared token.
2. **Off-scale spacing** — a spacing number (like `13px`) that does not
   match the sizes the team agreed on.
3. **Token adoption** — out of all the colors and spacing in the code, what
   percent use real tokens vs. hardcoded values.

It then gives the project one number: the **Drift Score**, from 0 to 100.
A higher score means the code follows the design system well. A lower
score means there is a lot of drift.

Finally, it writes all of this into one HTML report file you can open in
a browser, or upload to get a shareable web link.

**What it deliberately does *not* flag** (learned from scanning real
open-source projects — see section 6): test files (`*.test.ts`,
`*.spec.ts`), since they're often full of color literals used as test
data, not real UI code. Named colors (`red`, `blue`, etc., but not hex
codes) are also only flagged inside actual style code — a `style={{}}`
prop or a stylesheet — not inside plain data objects, since English color
words show up constantly in non-styling data (e.g. `{ label: 'Akron',
color: 'blue' }` in a dropdown options list).

## 2. The three parts of this project

### Part A — The CLI tool (`packages/cli`)

This is the actual scanner. "CLI" means **Command Line Interface** — a tool
you run by typing a command, not by clicking buttons. This is the part
real developers will install and run on their own projects.

- It has **no other software installed inside it** (called "zero
  dependencies"). This is on purpose — it makes the tool small, fast, and
  safe to trust with someone else's code.
- It gets published to **npm**, the library store for JavaScript. Once
  published, anyone can run it with `npx tokensdrift`.

### Part B — The website (`apps/web`)

A normal website, built with **Next.js**, live at **tokensdrift.com** (the
old `tokensdrift-vedantyedes-projects.vercel.app` Vercel URL still resolves
too). It does several jobs now:

1. **Homepage** — explains the product, shows a real sample scan.
2. **Hosted reports** (`/r/{id}`) — when someone runs the CLI with
   `--share`, it uploads the report here and shows it at a web address.
3. **README badges** (`/badge/{slug}.svg`) — a small image showing a
   repo's latest Drift Score, meant to be pasted into a project's README.
   It tracks *the repo*, not one single scan: rescanning the same repo
   updates the same badge instead of creating a new one.
4. **Email capture** — a "notify me when this score changes" form on
   hosted report pages, for the future paid-launch list. Nothing
   automated sends emails yet — it just saves the address.
5. **Teardown mode** — hosted (and local) reports can be dressed up as a
   "Published by TokensDrift" editorial write-up, for public content about
   open-source projects.
6. **Usage stats** (`/api/stats`) — a simple, no-login page showing how
   many reports have been shared and viewed in total.
7. **GitHub App** (`tokensdrift`) — installs on a GitHub account/org and
   watches pull requests. When a PR opens or updates, it scans the changed
   files and posts a pass/fail check: it only fails on drift the PR
   *added* — a file that already had problems before doesn't block
   anyone, only new ones do. See section 3b for how this works.

This website runs on **Vercel**, and needs two storage services connected:
- **Vercel Blob** — stores the actual report files.
- **Redis** (via Upstash) — a fast lookup table for reports, badges, and
  which repos have the GitHub App installed.

Both are already connected in production (see section 6).

### Part C — Internal scripts (`scripts/`)

Not part of the product — small tools for running the business.

- `scripts/draft-outreach.mjs` — scans a real target repo (a local path,
  or a public GitHub URL) and drafts a cold-outreach email from the real
  numbers. See section 4 for usage.

---

## 3. How a scan actually works, step by step

1. You type a command like `npx tokensdrift .` in a project's folder.
2. The tool looks at the project's settings, if any exist
   (`tokensdrift.config.js`), to learn the team's real tokens and spacing
   sizes.
3. It walks through every `.css`, `.scss`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.js`
   file, skipping folders like `node_modules` and `dist`, and skipping
   test files.
4. For each file, it checks every color and spacing value it finds. It
   marks each one as "on token" (good) or "hardcoded" (a problem).
5. It adds up all the results and calculates the Drift Score.
6. It writes an HTML report file to your computer.
7. If you added `--share`:
   - It removes anything that looks like a secret (like an API key).
   - It works out a stable ID for "this repo" from your git remote, so
     re-scanning the same repo later updates the same badge instead of
     making a new one.
   - It uploads just the report data — never your actual source code —
     to the website, and gives you back a link, a one-time delete link,
     and (if a git remote was found) a badge you can paste into a README.

## 3b. How the GitHub App's PR check works

This is separate from a normal scan — nobody has to type a command for
this one, it just happens automatically once the app is installed on a
repo.

1. Someone opens or updates a pull request on a repo that has the app
   installed.
2. GitHub sends TokensDrift's website a notification ("webhook") about it.
3. The website checks the notification is genuinely from GitHub (a signed
   secret only GitHub and the website know), then asks GitHub for a
   short-lived, scoped-down access token for just that one installation.
4. It asks GitHub which files changed in the PR, downloads each one's
   *before* (base branch) and *after* (PR branch) content, and scans both
   with the same scanner logic the CLI uses.
5. It compares the two: a violation only counts as "new" if it wasn't
   already there before the PR. Old problems in a file the PR merely
   touches don't fail anything — only genuinely new ones do. This is why
   it's called a "ratchet" — the score can't get worse over time on the
   parts being watched, only better.
6. It posts the result back to GitHub as a green check (nothing new) or a
   red one (lists exactly which new violations, and where).

Current limits, on purpose for now: it always uses the built-in default
scale/rules rather than fetching a repo's own custom token config yet,
and very large pull requests (200+ changed files) only get partially
scanned.

## 4. Commands — what to run, and when

All commands below assume you are inside the project's main folder
(`D:\Application\tokensdrift`), unless a step says otherwise.

### Set up the project (do this once, or after pulling new code)

```
npm install
```

### Build the CLI tool

```
npm run build --workspace packages/cli
```
Turns the CLI's source code into one runnable file:
`packages/cli/dist/index.js`. Run this again any time you change code
inside `packages/cli/src`.

### Check the code is correct (before publishing or committing)

```
npm run typecheck --workspace packages/cli
npm run test --workspace packages/cli
```
Both should say everything passed before you publish or push code.

### Scan a project with the CLI (the main feature)

```
node packages/cli/dist/index.js <folder-to-scan> -o report.html
```

Useful extra flags:
- `--json scan.json` — also saves the raw results as data, not just HTML.
- `--share` — uploads the report and gives you a web link, a delete link,
  and a badge (if a git remote is found).
- `--share-url <url>` — use a different server than the default. No longer
  needed for normal use now that the default points at `tokensdrift.com`;
  only useful for testing against a different deployment.
- `--teardown-title "..."` and `--teardown-note "..."` — render the
  report as a branded "Published by TokensDrift" editorial write-up
  instead of a plain report.

Since the CLI is published, this works too, and doesn't need the repo
checked out at all:
```
npx tokensdrift <folder-to-scan>
```

### Draft a cold-outreach email for a real target

```
node scripts/draft-outreach.mjs <path-or-github-url> [--name "Their Name"] [--share]
```
Scans the target and prints a ready-to-send email with the real score,
top offenders, and (with `--share`) a real hosted link.

### Publish the CLI to npm (makes `npx tokensdrift` work for everyone)

```
npm login
cd packages/cli
npm publish
```
`npm login` must be run by you, interactively. Publishing is **hard to
undo** — once live, anyone can download it. Each publish also needs a
fresh npm auth token (a Granular Access Token with "bypass 2FA" turned
on) — npm requires this per publish, it isn't a one-time setup.

### Run the website on your own computer

```
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```
Then open `http://localhost:3000`.

### Deploy the website to Vercel

```
npx vercel --prod
```
Run from the **repo root** (not `apps/web`) — the project needs the whole
monorepo present to resolve the CLI package it depends on. Connected to
GitHub, so a normal `git push` to `main` (the default branch) is
*supposed* to auto-deploy too — but as of this writing, pushes have been
landing as Preview deployments instead of Production, so `vercel --prod`
is still needed manually. Worth checking Vercel's dashboard (Settings →
Git → Production Branch) to confirm it says `main`.

### Save and share your code with git

```
git add <file names>
git commit -m "short description of what changed"
git push
```

## 6. Where this project stands right now

- **The CLI tool works** and has been tested against real open-source
  projects (not just the sample repo) — Dub, Twenty, and Formbricks.
  Testing against real code found and fixed four real scanner bugs: a
  crash on repos with tens of thousands of files, colors wrongly flagged
  outside real style code, colors wrongly flagged in test files, and (a
  known, unfixed limit) no way to recognize a company's own bespoke token
  files.
- **npm:** `tokensdrift@0.1.0` is published — `npx tokensdrift` works today.
  The old `tokendrift` package is deprecated (points anyone who finds it
  to the new name) but stays up since npm can't fully unpublish it.
- **GitHub:** renamed to `github.com/vedantyede/tokensdrift` (GitHub
  auto-redirects the old `tokendrift` URL, and the local git remote is
  updated to match). The default branch is `main` (renamed from
  `master`).
- **Vercel:** project renamed to `tokensdrift`, deployed and live at
  `tokensdrift-vedantyedes-projects.vercel.app` (the old `tokendrift-*`
  alias still resolves too — verified both point at the same live app and
  data), with Blob and Redis storage both connected. Connected to GitHub,
  but auto-deploy-on-push currently lands as a Preview rather than
  Production build — worth checking the Production Branch setting in
  Vercel's dashboard. Deploys have been done manually (`vercel --prod`) in
  the meantime.
- **Custom domain** (`tokensdrift.com`): bought and live. DNS points at
  Vercel's edge via an A record (through the registrar, not Vercel-managed
  nameservers — a fully valid setup). The apex domain redirects (308) to
  `www.tokensdrift.com`, which serves the real site. Verified live end to
  end: a full `--share` run against the default URL correctly followed the
  redirect, uploaded, and the hosted report loaded.
- **GitHub App**: renamed to `tokensdrift` (`github.com/apps/tokensdrift`),
  `GITHUB_APP_SLUG` updated to match and redeployed — verified live
  (`/install` redirects to the new slug's install page, which resolves).
  The PR ratchet check itself is live and verified against a real pull
  request — it correctly caught 2 intentionally-added violations and
  correctly ignored pre-existing ones.
- **Phase 1 (share MVP) and Phase 2 (badge + capture) are done.** Phase 3
  (public launch) is in progress: 3 real teardowns are live (see
  `ROADMAP.md` for links), and basic usage-stat tracking is live. Launch
  posts (Show HN, r/webdev, dev.to) haven't been written or posted yet, so
  the 500-cumulative-scan exit target hasn't been hit.
  **Phase 4 (paid product) was started deliberately ahead of Phase 3's
  finish line** — see `CLAUDE.md`'s phase note for why. Done: the GitHub
  App, the PR ratchet check, drift-delta PR comments (one comment per PR,
  edited in place on every push), and a dashboard at `/dashboard`
  (GitHub OAuth sign-in, repo list, latest score, a score trend
  sparkline, and a billing-portal link). Paddle billing (checkout, portal,
  webhook, plan gating) is built against Paddle's sandbox but not yet
  verified end to end with a real sandbox purchase. Slack weekly digests
  are not built yet — see `ROADMAP.md` for the full per-feature list.

## 7. Word list (plain meanings)

| Word | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Token** | A named, shared design value, like a color or spacing size, meant to be reused everywhere instead of retyped. |
| **Drift** | Code slowly stopping using the shared tokens, replaced by one-off hardcoded values. |
| **Drift Score** | A single number, 0–100, showing how much drift a project has. Higher is better. |
| **Badge** | A small image (like `85/100`) you paste into a README that shows a repo's latest score, and updates automatically when rescanned. |
| **Teardown** | A branded, public write-up of a scan, meant to be shared as content — different from a private report someone runs on their own code. |
| **CLI** | A tool you run by typing a command in a terminal, instead of clicking in an app. |
| **npm** | The official store where JavaScript tools and libraries are published and downloaded. |
| **npx** | A command that downloads and runs an npm tool for you, without installing it permanently. |
| **Repo** (repository) | A project's folder, tracked by git, so every change is saved as history. |
| **git** | Software that saves snapshots ("commits") of your code over time. |
| **GitHub** | A website that stores your git repo online, so others can see or contribute to it. |
| **Vercel** | A hosting company. It runs the TokensDrift website and gives it a public web address. |
| **Redis** | A fast lookup-table database, used here to remember report/badge data. |
| **CI** (Continuous Integration) | Automated checks that run every time code changes, to catch problems early. |
| **GitHub App** | A program that can be installed on a GitHub account/org to act on its repos with limited, specific permissions — here, reading code and posting PR checks. |
| **Webhook** | GitHub's way of notifying a website the moment something happens (a PR opens, a repo installs the app), instead of the website having to keep asking. |
| **Check Run** | The pass/fail result GitHub shows on a pull request — this is what the ratchet check posts. |
| **Ratchet** | A one-way rule: a score/check can only get better (or stay the same) over time, never quietly get worse, because new problems are blocked even though old ones aren't. |
